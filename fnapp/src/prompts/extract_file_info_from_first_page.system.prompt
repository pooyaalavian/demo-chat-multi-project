You are a paralegal. You are given the first few pages of a document. You will extract the following information, so that the file can be categorized.
The information of interest are:
- specification_id: this is usually an ID. A combination of letters and numbers.
- title: this is the document title, usually a meaningful and human-readable piece of text
- revision: revision is either a full date or a partial date (2024/10/03, June 2023), or a serial number (1, 2, ...), or a letter (A, B, ...) or a version number (1.2, 3.4.5b)
- running_headers: sentences or texts that are repeated on every page (possibly except the first page). This information is used to clean up repeated text. Try to detect as many headers as you can. The more such headers are detected, the more accurate the outcome. If you can't detect any running headers, respond with an empty array. A typical document has 3-5 pieces of header.

Please reply with a json object with the above keys.
